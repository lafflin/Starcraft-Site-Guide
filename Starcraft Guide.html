<h2>The Ultimate Guide to Starting Starcraft II</h2>
<ol><h3> Step One- Pick a Race to Play</h3>
<li>Terran-
  <p>Terran, the race of humans, is arguably the most versatile race of the three in the game. Terran has the capability to play two main styles, Bio; short for biological units, and mech; short for mechanical units. These two styles are distinct and change your play style drastically. Bio typically consists units such as marines, marauders, and medivacs, while sprinkiling in some mechanical units, such as liberators and siege tanks. This style is typically faster paced and requires more multitasking. As opposed to bio, mech is a style that requires refined understanding of timings and great defense. This stlye uses almost all of the mechanical units, depending on the enemy race and unit compositions. This includes hellions, siege tanks, liberators, vikings, and more. Both styles are viable, and require a high level of mastery to play at the highest levels.</p>

<li>Protoss-
  <p>Protoss is the race of alien robots. They use high tech units that often take more supply and resources, but are some of the strongest individual units in the game. Due to having some of the strongest units in the game that are also the most expensive, they can also have a rough early game. Without defensive structures the protoss can be left in hard positions when defending their second and third bases. Protoss has two main styles of play, ground and air. The ground force often consists of units such as the zealots, sentries, archons, high templar, colossuses, and disruptors. This force is expensive, with high area of effect damage, leading to them neading to take good fights, unless they will have a hard time rebuilding their armies and may die after bad fights. The air compositions often consists of units such as void rays, carriers, and oracles, while having a few ground units such as high templars for area of effect damage. This composition must take good fights however, as losing the whole army in a bad fight often is an instant loss due to the high build times of their units. Both styles are played at the highest levels, and require a high level of refinement to play correctly. </p>

<li>Zerg-
  <p>Zerg is the race of alien bugs. A main mechanic of zerg workers is that they die in order to build buildings. Because of this they do not have typical production buildings, they build all of their units out of their hatchery. The prerequisite to building units however is sacraficing a drone to build buildings such as a roach warren, to allow you to build roaches. Due to this mechanic of building all units out of their hatchery zerg tends to focus on "droning" or focusing on building workers during most of the early game. Because of this it is important to have vision using overlords and spotter zerglings to know when the opponent is going for attacks, to provide ample time to build army units to defend attacks so that they do not take economic damage. Zerg tends to focus on building their whole economy before building army units. When they do build army units, their composition is often reactive to the enemy composition. When a zerg sees many seige tanks, they know that roaches will not do good. When a zerg sees collosus, they know that hydralisks will not be a good unit. Zerg requires an understanding of timings and all unit interactions so that they can require properly in a timely manner.</p></li>
