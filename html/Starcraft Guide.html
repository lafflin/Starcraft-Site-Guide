    <h2>The Ultimate Guide to Starting Starcraft II</h2>
    <main>
      <p class="opening">
        Starcraft II is PC game made in the image of its predecessor, Starcraft:
        Brood War. As such, the races are the same, and many units remain from
        the original games, such as the iconic marines, zerglings, and zealots
        The first step to starting the game is to pick your race, either Terran,
        Protoss, or Zerg.

            <h4>Terran</h4>
            <p>
              Terran, the race of humans, is arguably the most versatile race of
              the three in the game. Terran has the capability to play two main
              styles, Bio; short for biological units, and mech; short for
              mechanical units. These two styles are distinct and change your
              play style drastically. Bio typically consists units such as
              marines, marauders, and medivacs, while sprinkling in some
              mechanical units, such as liberators and siege tanks. This style
              is typically faster paced and requires more multitasking. As
              opposed to bio, mech is a style that requires refined
              understanding of timings and great defense. This style uses almost
              all of the mechanical units, depending on the enemy race and unit
              compositions. This includes hellions, siege tanks, liberators,
              vikings, and more. Both styles are viable, and require a high
              level of mastery to play at the highest levels.

            <h4>Protoss</h4>
            <p>
              Protoss is the race of alien robots. They use high tech units that
              often take more supply and resources, but are some of the
              strongest individual units in the game. Due to having some of the
              strongest units in the game that are also the most expensive, they
              can also have a rough early game. Without defensive structures the
              Protoss can be left in hard positions when defending their second
              and third bases. Protoss has two main styles of play, ground and
              air. The ground force often consists of units such as the zealots,
              sentries, archons, high templar, colossuses, and disruptors. This
              force is expensive, with high area of effect damage, leading to
              them needing to take good fights, unless they will have a hard
              time rebuilding their armies and may die after bad fights. The air
              compositions often consists of units such as void rays, carriers,
              and oracles, while having a few ground units such as high templars
              for area of effect damage. This composition must take good fights
              however, as losing the whole army in a bad fight often is an
              instant loss due to the high build times of their units. Both
              styles are played at the highest levels, and require a high level
              of refinement to play correctly.

            <h4>Zerg</h4>
            <p>
              Zerg is the race of alien bugs. A main mechanic of Zerg workers is
              that they die in order to build buildings. Because of this they do
              not have typical production buildings, they build all of their
              units out of their hatchery. The prerequisite to building units
              however is sacrificing a drone to build buildings such as a roach
              warren, to allow you to build roaches. Due to this mechanic of
              building all units out of their hatchery Zerg tends to focus on
              "droning" or focusing on building workers during most of the early
              game. Because of this it is important to have vision using
              overlords and spotter zerglings to know when the opponent is going
              for attacks, to provide ample time to build army units to defend
              attacks so that they do not take economic damage. Zerg tends to
              focus on building their whole economy before building army units.
              When they do build army units, their composition is often reactive
              to the enemy composition. When a Zerg sees many seige tanks, they
              know that roaches will not do good. When a Zerg sees collosus,
              they know that hydralisks will not be a good unit. Zerg requires
              an understanding of timings and all unit interactions so that they
              can require properly in a timely manner.

      Now that we have established a base idea of what each race does, it is up
      to you to pick a race. If you do not know which race you would like to
      pick already, I suggest downloading the game &#40it's free!&#41 and trying out each race for around 10 minutes. I would not spend too long worrying about which race to pick, as once you pick one and begin to learn the game, it will be much easier to pick up another race. Once you do this, you can navigate to the specific race pages on the sight by click the race's logo above.
